# CPP Mini Projects

A collection of small but functional **C++ command-line interface (CLI)** projects, structured using **modular programming** with separate header (`.h`) and source (`.cpp`) files.  
These projects focus on implementing real-world concepts while keeping the code clean, reusable, and easy to understand.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains beginner-to-intermediate level projects designed to strengthen your C++ fundamentals.  
Each project:

- Runs entirely in the **command-line interface** (no GUI).
- Is **modularized** into separate header and implementation files.
- Demonstrates **OOP principles**, **file handling**, and **basic algorithms**.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Included

- **Banking-System**  
  Simulates basic banking operations such as creating accounts, deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks.

- **LOGIN_PAGE**  
  CLI-based login authentication system that verifies user credentials.

- **Password Generator**  
  Generates secure, random passwords based on user-defined length and complexity.

*(More projects will be added soon!)*
